# NVIM-LaTeX_Integration

This repository contains the continuation of my VIM-LaTeX_Integration. It contains some configuration files and resources to take notes as efficiently as possible using LaTeX.

Based on Gilles Castel note taking method. https://castel.dev/

Make sure you are running NVIM 0.11.1 with python 3 support before installing. It may be possible to run the build in earlier versions of NVIM but it hasn't been tested.

Templates are modified versions of overleaf templates.
